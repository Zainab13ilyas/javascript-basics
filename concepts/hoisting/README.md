🚀 Hoisting in JavaScript

📚 Overview

Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving function and variable declarations to the top of their scope before execution. This means you can use a function or variable before actually declaring it in the code.

🔥 Running the Code

🏃‍♂️ Method 1: Open in Browser

Step 1. Locate index.html inside the hoisting/ folder.

Step 2. Double-click to open it in a web browser.

Step 3. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I).

Step 4. Check the Console Tab to see hoisting in action.

🏃‍♂️ Method 2: Running the File from the Cloned Repo (For Debugging & Call Stack Analysis)
To step through execution and analyze Call Stack & Memory, follow these steps:

Step 1. Clone the Repository:

If you haven’t cloned the repo yet, run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-basics.git
Then navigate to the hoisting folder:

cd javascript-basics/concepts/hoisting

Step 2. Open in a Browser for Debugging:

Open the example.html file in a browser.
On Windows: Double-click example.html.
On Mac/Linux: Open it with a browser manually.

🔍 Viewing Call Stack & Memory

1. Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I)

2. Go to the Sources tab

3. Click on example.js (inside concepts/hoisting/ folder)

4. Add a Breakpoint: Click on a line number to pause execution.

5. Step Through the Code:

6. The Call Stack shows function execution order.

7. The Scope & Memory Panel shows variable values at different points.
