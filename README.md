# **JavaScript Basics**

A repository explaining fundamental JavaScript concepts like hoisting, closures, execution context, event loop, and more.

## **How to Use This Repo**

1. **Navigate to a Concept Folder:**
   Each JavaScript concept is organized into its own folder. Click on a topic to explore:

   - [Hoisting](./concepts/hoisting)
   - [Scope & Closures](./concepts/scope-closures/)
   - [Execution Context & Call Stack](./concepts/execution-context-and-call-stack/)
   - ["this" Keyword & Binding](./concepts/this-keyword/)
   - [Asynchronous JavaScript](./concepts/asynchronous-javascript/)

2. **Start by Reading the Documentation:**
   Inside each folder, you'll find a **`.docx` file** explaining the concept with examples:

   - 📄 [Hoisting Doc](./concepts/hoisting/explanation.docx)
   - 📄 [Scope & Closures Doc](./concepts/scope-closures/explanation.docx)
   - 📄 [Execution Context Doc](./concepts/execution-context-and-call-stack/explanation.docx)
   - 📄 ["this" Keyword Doc](./concepts/this-keyword/explanation.docx)
   - 📄 [Asynchronous JavaScript Doc](./concepts/asynchronous-javascript/explanation.docx)

3. **Run the Example Code:**
   Open the corresponding `example.js` file and test it in the browser console:

   - 📝 [Hoisting Example](./concepts/hoisting/example.js)
   - 📝 [Scope & Closures Example](./concepts/scope-closures/example.js)
   - 📝 [Execution Context Example](./concepts/execution-context-and-call-stack/example.js)
   - 📝 ["this" Keyword Example](./concepts/this-keyword/example.js)
   - 📝 [Asynchronous JavaScript Example](./concepts/asynchronous-javascript/example.js)

   **Steps:**

   - Open your browser and go to **Developer Tools** (`Inspect → Console`).
   - Run the script and observe the output.
   - Detailed instructions in [Instructions](./concepts/README.md)

4. **Tweak the Code & Analyze the Call Stack**
   - Modify the examples, change variable declarations, and add console logs to see how the behavior changes.
   - Use **debugging tools** (e.g., breakpoints in DevTools) to step through execution and observe the **call stack**.
