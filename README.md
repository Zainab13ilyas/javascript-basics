# **JavaScript Basics**

A repository explaining fundamental JavaScript concepts like hoisting, closures, execution context, event loop, and more.

## **How to Use This Repo**

1. **Navigate to a Concept Folder**

   - Each JavaScript concept is organized into its own folder (e.g., `hoisting/`, `closures/`, etc.).

2. **Start by Reading the Documentation**

   - Inside each folder, you'll find a **README.md** or a **`.docx` file** explaining the concept with examples.

3. **Run the Example Code**

   - Open the `example.js` file in any folder.
   - Open your browser and go to **Developer Tools** (`Inspect → Console`).
   - Run the script and observe the output.
   - Detailed instructions in [Instructions](./concepts/README.md)

4. **Tweak the Code & Analyze the Call Stack**
   - Modify the examples, change variable declarations, and add console logs to see how the behavior changes.
   - Use **debugging tools** (e.g., breakpoints in DevTools) to step through execution and observe the **call stack**.
